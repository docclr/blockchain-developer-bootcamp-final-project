# Community DeFi Onboarding
## Overview
### Problem: Small business lenders each have their own requirements for loan applications; often causing 8-12 week application processing. Small business owners often have to apply to field multiple applications. The majority of the applications are similar with the exception of organization specific items. Agreement at the community level on a group of items could accelerate the application process for small business applicants.
### Project Description: Develop a Community Lending DAO. Purpose of the DAO would be for lending and technical assistance providers to agree on which set of documents would be acceptable to a financial consortium to expedite the application process. Members register to participate and vote on forms. Voting once per package. Users validate participating agencies via web based tool.
